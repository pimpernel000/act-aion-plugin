This is a plugin to ACT (advancedcombattracker.com) so that ACT will parse Aion chat logs. This plugin also attempts to make educated guesses at the attackers or victims where there are ambiguity.

ACT by EQAditu is originally a combat/chat log parser for EQ2 with some extensive damage analysis to calculate DPS for each battle/encounter.

This is a branch-version of Creub's original Aion Parse Plugin for ACT v.0.1.0.3 and the original description is available at the [EQ2Flames forum thread](http://www.eq2flames.com/plugin-discussion/53384-aion-parse-plugin-act-v-0-1-0-3-a.html)

You can also download the latest version of this plugin under the Plugin Downloads section of the official Advanced Combat Tracker [download page](http://advancedcombattracker.com/download.php).
